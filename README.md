# Implementation-of-Simple-Linear-Regression-Model-for-Predicting-the-Marks-Scored

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the marks scored by a student using the simple linear regression model.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
### Step1
Import the standard Libraries.

### Step2
Set variables for assigning dataset values.

### Step3
Import linear regression from sklearn.

### Step4
Assign the points for representing in the graph.

### Step5
Predict the regression for marks by using the representation of the graph.

### Step6
Compare the graphs and hence we obtained the linear regression for the given datas.

## Program:
Program to implement the simple linear regression model for predicting the marks scored.
## Developed by: jagadeesh reddy
